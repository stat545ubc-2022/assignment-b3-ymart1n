![](www/crypto.jpg)

This [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) has 11 interactive cryptocurrency market data plots and tables that can be hovered over to show more information at a specific point or downloaded as a png picture, etc. By modifying the date range using the slider on the left panel, users can interact with the plot. The user can also select the data set to be visualised by utilising the select input, which is located at the left panel as well.

## Features

1. Add CSS to make the app look nicer
    - In the [CSS file](www/style.css), In the CSS file, I changed the background color of pickerInput to orange when it's focused so that it matches the other widgets' colors.
    - The color of sliderInput is also changed to match the colors.

2. Add an image to the UI
    - Adding an [image](www/crypto.jpg) of various cryptocurrency coins to increase the app's visual appeal and convey a clear understanding of its purpose to users.

3. Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny
    - Adding [`plotly` library](https://plotly.com/r/) to enable interactive charts with plot_ly, which can be hovered over to show more information at a specific point or downloaded as a png picture, etc.
    - Adding [`shinyWidgets` library](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets) to use pickerInput, which is a selectInput substitute with a wide range of customization possibilities.

4. Allow the user to download the table in specified time range as a .csv file
    - Implemented using `downloadButton()` and `downloadHandler()` methods.

5. Use the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table
    - Implemented using `DT::dataTableOutput()` and `DT::renderDataTable()` methods.
