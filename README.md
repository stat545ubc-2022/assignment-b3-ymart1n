## Features (TODO)

1. Plotly plot -> robust, can interact with the plot and download as png
  1. time range slider
2. If you know CSS, add CSS to make your app look nicer.
Hint: Add a CSS file under www and use the function includeCSS() to use it in your app.
  1. Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as shinyjs, leaflet, shinydashboard, shinythemes, ggvis. -> shinyWidgets -> pickerInput, similar to selectInput but can customize/style it easier
3. Add an image to the UI. In the case of the BC Liquor app, you could add an image of the BC Liquor Store. If youâ€™re building your own app from scratch, an image may make your app more visually interesting or add information!
Hint: Place the image in a folder named www, and use img(src = "imagename.png") to add the image.
